# GitHub for Digital Aotearoa 

### Motivation 

We're trying to get more community members up-to-speed on how to contribute using the tools of Git, GitHub and Markdown. This will allow us to manage and share documentation as plain text known as Markdown. Markdown is a way of coding text in such a way that it can be rendered to HTML equivalents. What does that mean, basically while writing plain text, we can make special annotations to how we eventually want that text to be rendered.

For example, if we want the following text:

The quick **brown** fox jumped over the *lazy* dog. 

We can type 

```
The quick **brown** fox jumped over the *lazy* dog.
```

Note that we're using `**brown**` to denote that we want brown to be in bold, and `*lazy*` to denote that we want lazy to be italicized.

By learning a few more annotation rules, we can have bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, headings. Managing our documentation in plain text allows us to convert it into any format we might like, a web page, a PDF, a typeset article or book to name a few examples. We do this because we're able to separate the styling itself (what fonts, their sizes etc) from the text content. 

## Quick Hands-on Lesson 

#### Objectives
* Create a GitHub account
* Login to GitHub
* Understand the Git contribution model
* Make your first contribution to a training repository
* Consider how you'd contribute to public repositories

* GitHub - a company that makes the Git software work in a web browser
* Repository - a special file folder which can track the changes within it using Git
* Commit - a set of changes made to files in a repository
* Branch - a series of commits in a Git Repository given a special name

* Merge - how two distinct branches of changes are brought together

#### Lesson Steps 

- [Sign up for an account](https://github.com/signup)
  - Choose a username you want to be identified with, it will be the handle by which others you collaborate with will find you.
- Login 
- Looking at a few GitHub Account / Settings
    -  [Profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) – your public face on GitHub, others might check it to figure out who you are. Pays to spend a bit of work on it.
    -  [Billing](https://github.com/settings/billing) – GitHub is a business, for $4.00 per month you can get some benefits, but you absolutely don't need to pay for it.
    -  [Organizations](https://github.com/settings/organizations) – are special GitHub accounts that can be owned by multiple people. Great for managing group projects. Also great when you back-away from a project so others can own/control it.
- Creating a Repository (public / private)
   - To create a repository [go here](https://github.com/new)
    - give your repository a name – `learning-git` maybe
    - click "Public" 
    - click "Add a README file" 
    - click "Create repository"
- Adding a `README.md` file to your own repository
- Contributing a PR to a repository [git-collaboration](https://github.com/jduckles/git-collaboration)
- Fork / submit change / create pull request / wait for PR to be reviewed
- Show contributions, talk about merging them into the main repository
- We can do the same with the [rac-guide](https://github.com/govzeroaotearoa/rac-guide)
