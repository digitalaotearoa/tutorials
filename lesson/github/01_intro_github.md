# GitHub for Digital Aotearoa 

### Motivation 

We're trying to get more community members up-to-speed on how to contribute using the tools of Git, GitHub and Markdown. This will allow us to manage and share documentation as plain text known as Markdown. Markdown is a way of coding text in such a way that it can be rendered to HTML equivalents. What does that mean, basically while writing plain text, we can make special annotations to how we eventually want that text to be rendered.

For example, if we want the following text:

The quick **brown** fox jumped over the *lazy* dog. 

We can type 

```
The quick **brown** fox jumped over the *lazy* dog.
```

Note that we're using `**brown**` to denote that we want brown to be in bold, and `*lazy*` to denote that we want lazy to be italicized.

By learning a few more annotation rules, we can have bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, headings. Managing our documentation in plain text allows us to convert it into any format we might like, a web page, a PDF, a typeset article or book to name a few examples. We do this because we're able to separate the styling itself (what fonts, their sizes etc) from the text content.
